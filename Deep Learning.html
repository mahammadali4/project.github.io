            <h3>What is Deep Learning?</h3>
            <p>
                Deep learning is a branch of Machine Learning which is completely based on Artificial Neural Networks(ANN), as neural network is going to mimic the human brain so deep learning is also a kind of mimic of human brain.
                 In deep learning, we don’t need to explicitly program everything. The concept of deep learning is not new. It has been around for a couple of years now. It’s on hype nowadays because earlier we did not have that much processing power and a lot of data.
                  As in the last 20 years, the processing power increases exponentially, deep learning and machine learning came in the picture. A formal definition of deep learning is- neurons
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) with multiple layers, also known as deep neural networks (DNNs).
                 These neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, and they are designed to learn from large amounts of data in an unsupervised or semi-supervised manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deep Learning models are able to automatically learn features from the data, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
                 The most widely used architectures in deep learning are feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
            </p>
            <p>
                Feedforward neural networks (FNNs) are the simplest type of ANN, with a linear flow of information through the network. FNNs have been widely used for tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural networks that are able to process sequential data, such as time series and natural language. 
                RNNs are able to maintain an internal state that captures information about the previous inputs, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and language translation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deep Learning models are trained using large amounts of labeled data and require significant computational resources.
                 With the increasing availability of large amounts of data and computational resources, deep learning has been able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of applications such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more.
            </p>
            <blockquote><p>
                Deep learning is a particular kind of machine learning that achieves great power and flexibility by learning to represent the world as a nested hierarchy of concepts, with each concept defined in relation to simpler concepts, and more abstract representations computed in terms of less abstract ones.
            </p></blockquote>

                In human brain approximately 100 billion neurons all together this is a picture of an individual neuron and each neuron is connected through thousand of their neighbours. 
                The question here is how do we recreate these neurons in a computer. So, we create an artificial structure called an artificial neural net where we have nodes or neurons. 
                We have some neurons for input value and some for output value and in between, there may be lots of neurons interconnected in the hidden layer.

                    <strong>Deep Neural Network</strong>
                    – It is a neural network with a certain level of complexity (having multiple hidden layers in between input and output layers).
                     They are capable of modeling and processing non-linear relationships.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Deep Belief network(DBN)</strong>
                    – It is a class of Deep Neural Network. It is multi-layer belief networks. 
                    <strong><h4>Steps for Performing DBN: </h4></strong>
                    <ul>
                    <li> a. Learn a layer of features from visible units using Contrastive Divergence algorithm.</li>
                    <li>b. Treat activations of previously trained features as visible units and then learn features of features.</li>
                    <li>c. Finally, the whole DBN is trained when the learning for the final hidden layer is achieved.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <strong>Recurrent</strong>
                    (perform same task for every element of a sequence)
                    <strong>Neural Network</strong>
                    – Allows for parallel and sequential computation. Similar to the human brain (large feedback network of connected neurons). They are able to remember important things about the input they received and hence enables them to be more precise.

                <li>
                    It requires large amounts of labelled data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data dependency :</strong> learning models require a large amount of data to be trained effectively. Without enough data, the model may not be able to learn the underlying patterns and may perform poorly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Computationally intensive: </strong>Training a deep learning model can be computationally intensive, requiring high-performance hardware such as GPUs. This can be expensive and time-consuming, especially for large-scale applications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Overfitting</strong> : Deep learning models can be prone to overfitting, where the model learns the training data too well and fails to generalize to new data. This can be mitigated through techniques such as regularization and data augmentation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lack of interpretability:</strong>  Deep learning models are often considered “black boxes” because they are difficult to interpret and understand how they make decisions. This can be a challenge for applications where interpretability is important, such as in healthcare or finance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Limited data efficiency:</strong>  Deep learning models require a large amount of data to be trained effectively, which can be a challenge in applications where data is scarce or expensive to obtain.
